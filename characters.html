            <!--Insert Kuzco Image-->
            <div class="character-content">
                <h2>Kuzco</h2>
                <p class="title">Emperor</p>
                <!--Add internal link to cast page-->
                <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: David Spade</p>
                <p>Kuzco is a self-centered, sarcastic teenage emperor who learns a big lesson in humility after being turned into a llama. Through his wild journey to return to human form, he discovers the value of friendship, kindness, and not making people homeless for a summer getaway. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Pacha Image-->
        <div class="character-content">
            <h2>Pacha</h2>
            <p class="title">Humble Villager</p>
            <!--Add internal link to cast page-->
            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: John Goodman</p>
            <p>Pacha is a kind-hearted peasant who lives in a quiet village int he mountains. He reluctantly reams up with Kuzco to help him get back to the palace, and through their adventure, he becomes the emperor's first true friend and moral compass. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Yzma Image-->
        <div class="character-content">
            <h2>Yzma</h2>

            <!--Add internal link to cast page-->
            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: Eartha Kitt</p>
            <p>Yzma is Kuzco's power-hungry ex-advisoer, known for her dramatic flair and wild plans. After being fired, she hatches a ridiculous scheme to take over the empire - with lots of potions, traps, and cackling along the way. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Kronk Image-->
        <div class="character-content">
            <h2>Kronk</h2>

            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: Patrick Warburton</p>
            <p>Kronk is Yzma's loyal (but very clueless) sidekick. Despite working for the villain, he's sweet, loves cooking, and has a strong moral compass - sometimes guided by conversations between his shoulder angel and devil. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Chicha Image-->
        <div class="character-content">
            <h2>Chicha</h2>

            <p>Chicha is smart, no-nonsenese, and fiercely supportive of her family. She's pregnant, but don't underestimate her - she handles chaos like a pro and helps keep things running smoothly while Pacha is away. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Tipo and Chaca Image-->

            <!--Add internal link to cast page-->
            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: Eli Russell (Tipo), Kellyann Kelso (Chaca)</p>
            <p>Tipo is the energetic son and Chaca is the sassy daughter. These two bring humor and heart to the film, and they're quick to join in on a good prank to helpr their parents. </p>

            <h2>Bucky the Squirrel</h2>

            <p>Bucky may be small, but he plays a big role in Kuzco's journey. Known for his high-pitched squeeks and a grudge against Kuzco, Bucky is a surprisingly influential forest critter. </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Theme song guy Image-->

            <!--Add internal link to cast page-->
            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: Tom Jones</p>
            <p>He sings the catch "Kuzco... Kuzcooo!" opening song and sets the tone for the movie. He's not in the movie for long, but his intro is unforgettable. </p>
        </div>
        <!--The old man-->
        <div class="character-content">
            <h2>The Old Man (Thrown Out the Window)</h2>

            <!--Add internal link to cast page-->
            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: John Fiedler</p>
            <p>He speaks up against Kuzko's arrogance - and gets tossed out a window for it. He pops up a couple of times in the movie with perfect comedic timing </p>
        </div>
        <!--Insert Diner Duo Image-->
        <div class="character-content">
            <h2>Restaurant Chef and Waitress</h2>

            <p class="actor"> Voice Actor: Patti Deutsch (Waitress), Jeff Bennett (Chef)</p>
            <p>They run the jungle diner where chaos ensues as Kuzco, Pacha, Yzma, and Kronk all show up. Their reaction to the madness is one of the funniest scenes in the film. </p>
