        <h2 class="plot__title"> Kuzco's Big Plans (and Bigger Ego) </h2>
        <p class="plot__text"> Emperor Kuzco is the ultimate diva. He's selfish, arrogant, and only cares about one thing—himself. His latest plan? To build a luxurious summer palace. But the problem is, it's being built on the land of a hardworking peasant named Pacha. Kuzco decides to destroy Pacha's entire village to make room for his palace. Naturally, Pacha's not thrilled about this, but Kuzco couldn't care less.
          
          Meanwhile, Yzma, the royal advisor, is fed up with being ignored by Kuzco. So, in a moment of "out with the old, in with the new," she tries to poison the emperor and take his throne. But instead of killing him, the poison turns Kuzco into a llama. Whoops.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="plot">
        <h2 class="plot__title">Llama Trouble </h2>
        <p class="plot__text">Now stuck as a llama, Kuzco is dumped in the jungle and left for dead. He's confused, lost, and—without a plan—completely helpless. But then, Pacha (the guy whose village Kuzco almost destroyed) stumbles upon him. Reluctantly, Pacha agrees to help the emperor, but only if Kuzco promises to spare his village once he gets back to the palace. A llama Kuzco is not thrilled about this, but he's got no choice. So, they head off together on an unlikely adventure to return to the palace. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="plot">
        <h2 class="plot__title">A Journey of (Mild) Self-Discovery</h2>
        <p class="plot__text">Kuzco and Pacha's trip is full of complications. From dangerous wildlife to slippery cliffs, the journey is anything but smooth. Along the way, Kuzco remains stubborn and annoying, bossing Pacha around. However, despite Kuzco's behavior, Pacha stays calm, always trying to teach the emperor valuable lessons about kindness, humility, and thinking about others.

          Meanwhile, Yzma and her goofy sidekick, Kronk, are on Kuzco's tail. They've figured out he's still alive and are determined to finish the job. But things aren't going quite as planned—Kronk is hilariously incompetent, and he keeps making mistakes. It's an ongoing comedy show as the duo tries (and fails) to catch Kuzco. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="plot">
        <h2 class="plot__title">Will Kuzco Learn His Lesson?</h2>
        <p class="plot__text">As the journey continues, Kuzco's attitude begins to shift. He starts to appreciate Pacha's wisdom and realizes that maybe his old ways weren't so great. He begins to question whether all the luxury and power he wanted was really worth it. Still, it's a long way to go before he fully understands the value of friendship and community.

          While Kuzco is growing, Yzma is getting closer. She's got a trap ready, and this time, it might actually work. Kuzco and Pacha have to figure out how to stop her before it's too late. But this time, they're not just trying to save Kuzco—they're learning how to work together.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="plot">
        <h2 class="plot__title">The Showdown at the Palace</h2>
        <p class="plot__text">After narrowly escaping Yzma's trap, Kuzco and Pacha finally make it back to the palace. But Yzma's not backing down. It's time for a full-blown showdown. In the middle of all the chaos, Kronk—who's been struggling with his loyalty to Yzma—has a change of heart and decides to help Kuzco and Pacha. Together, they manage to outwit Yzma and her plans to take the throne.

          And guess what? Kuzco's back in power, but he's not quite the same emperor he was before. Sure, he's back to being human, but the journey has taught him some important lessons.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="plot">
        <h2 class="plot__title">Kuzco's Big Change</h2>
        <p class="plot__text">Now that Kuzco has regained control of the throne, he doesn't want to go back to his selfish ways. Instead of building his lavish summer palace, Kuzco decides to help Pacha rebuild his village—one that he almost destroyed earlier. The emperor now sees the importance of caring for others, and he makes things right. Pacha is over the moon, and the village is saved.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="plot">
        <h2 class="plot__title">A New (and Improved) Emperor</h2>
        <p class="plot__text">Kuzco is no longer the arrogant, egotistical ruler he once was. He's been changed by his journey with Pacha. The film ends with Kuzco ruling the Inca Empire with a much kinder heart. He's no longer interested in lavish palaces or self-indulgence, but rather in caring for the people around him. His relationship with Pacha is stronger than ever, and together, they're ready to lead the empire in a new direction—one where kindness and humility reign.</p>
